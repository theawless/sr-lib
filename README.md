# sr-lib
C++ Automatic Speech Recognition library for my [BTech Project](https://github.com/theawless/BTech-Project). 

### Features
* Isolated Word Recognition
* Word Prediction
* Sentence Recognition (using isolated words)
* Parallel and fast
* Configurable
* Portable

### Results
* Test recordings are english digts (words) and few country codes (sentences)
* Accuracy for single speaker isolated word recognition: ~90%

### Methods
* Audio Preprocessor
* Linear Predictive Cepstral Coefficients (LPCC)
* Mel Filter Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC)
* Derivative Cepstral Coefficients (delta, accel)
* Vector Quantisation (VQ) - LBG, KMeans
* Hidden Markov Model (HMM) - Baumâ€“Welch, Viterbi
* DFA and NGram

### Extras
* CSV Reader
* Wave Reader
* Logger
* Thread Pool
* Config Parser

### How to build?

sr-lib doesn't depend on any libraries other than the standard ones.

For windows:
* Get Visual Studio 2017 (with cmake tools).
* Open sr-lib as a folder
* Click `Generate cache` from CMake menu
* Click `Build All` from CMake menu
* Select run target WordRecognition (preferably x64 release)
* Run to see the demo
* Profit???

For others:
* Use the command line :(

### How to improve accuracy?

In general, isolated word recognition works well for:

* distinct words in the vocabulary
* short utterance durations
* fewer words in the vocabulary

These parameters can be fine tuned:
